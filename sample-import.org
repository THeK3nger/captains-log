** 14:30 First entry of the day
This is the content of my first entry. It can contain *bold text*, /italic text/, and even ~code blocks~.

Multiple paragraphs are supported.

** 16:45 Another entry
This entry has some interesting formatting:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def hello():
    print("Hello from imported code!")
#+END_SRC

And some lists:
• First item
• Second item
  • Nested item

** 18:20
This entry has no title, just content.

This is a quoted section that will be imported correctly.
#+END_QUOTE

** 12:30 Lunch time
Quick note about lunch. Had a nice meal with [[https://example.com][a friend]].
